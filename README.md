# Northcoders News Front-end Application

Hello there!

Thank you for your interest in my first front-end project.

You can explore the deployed version of the app [here](https://ncnews-zaira.netlify.app/).  
Please note that since this project works on an API hosted on a free plan, there may be delays of 50 seconds or more due to inactivity causing the server to spin down. Thanks for your patience.

## Overview

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website. Articles are categorised into topics, with each article featuring user-curated ratings through upvotes and downvotes. Users can log in and out, as well as add and delete comments on articles. Additionally, users can sort articles by date created, number of comments and number of votes, with options to toggle between ascending and descending order.
