Hello there!

Thank you for your interest in my first front-end project.

You can explore the deployed version of the app [here](https://ncnews-zaira.netlify.app/).  
Please note that since this project works on an API hosted on a free plan, there may be delays of 50 seconds or more due to inactivity causing the server to spin down. Thanks for your patience.
